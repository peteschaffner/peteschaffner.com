# I Hate Figma

Most of my colleagues have moved over to Figma for their day-to-day design work. They taught being able to collaborate as being one of the best features.

It feels like Google Docs/Sheets/Slides (which I also hate), with those damn little heads and cursors floating around, reminding you that every move you make is being watched. Fuck that. I want to work in private.

So with the collaboration bit out the window, what is left? Iâ€™ll tell you what: long load times, CPU spikes, no battery and shit context menus.
