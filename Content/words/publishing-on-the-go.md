# Publishing on the Go

I recently wrote about [changing my website setup](/words/a-new-year-a-new-site): “This site was originally hosted by GitHub Pages, but I decided I didn’t want all my eggs in one basket (being my remote was enough—no need for them to handle building and hosting as well).”

Well, I’m kinda eating my words, as I’ve decided to use GitHub to [build and publish](https://github.com/peteschaffner/peteschaffner.com/blob/master/.github/workflows/publish.yml).
