# A Guide To Ellipsising...

The ellipsis (...) is a handy character in writing and user interface design, but I always second guess myself when it comes time to use it. So here is a reference for future me.

## In menus and buttons

The [macOS HIG](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/menus/menu-anatomy/) spells it out quite nicely:

> **Use an ellipsis whenever choosing a menu item requires additional input from the user.** The ellipsis character (…) means a dialog or separate window will open and prompt the user for additional information or to make a choice.

I think too often we latch on to the “[...] means a dialog or separate window will open” part of that guideline, and forget the critical **and** that follows.

Even so, I still hesitate too often, so here is another rules of thumb I find helpful:

> If the title implies further input/processing (e.g. “Manage Passwords”, ”Find in Page”), or that a new dialog/sheet/alert/window/etc. will be opened (e.g. “Open Bookmarks”), omit the ellipsis.
