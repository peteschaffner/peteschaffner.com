Steve Troughton-Smith [writes about Catalyst](https://www.highcaffeinecontent.com/blog/20190601-Why-Apple-needs-iPad-apps-on-the-Mac):

> That NeXT competitive advantage became Apple's competitive advantage, and, later, iPhone's competitive advantage. This is the competitive advantage a native platform from Apple has over the web; it would be such a shame to half-ass this transition to Marzipan and concede defeat to web apps on the desktop instead of letting native apps reach the heights they deserve.

From what I’ve seen so far in Catalina, Apple has done some half-assing. People like Steve, however, have shown us that we can make richer macOS Catalyst apps—it just takes some time, knowhow, and care. I hope Apple will improve on their half-assed wares, but in the meantime 3rd-party developers need to raise the bar.
