Marc Andreessen says in the foreword of *Becoming Steve Jobs*:

> There’s a concept in some countries called the **tall poppy syndrome**, where everybody has to be average. It’s culturally very important for everybody to be the same. If anybody ever sticks their head up and says, “No, no, I can do something special,” or “I can be special,” they get it chopped off.

> There’s a major urge in American society today to implement the tall poppy syndrome. It’s this movement right now in politics and economics, this purported ideal that everybody ought to be equal, which is to say, for nobody to be special. Steve embodied the other side of that. The whole point of Steve, and the whole point of Apple, was to be special, was to be the tall poppy.”

“Tall poppy syndrome” sounds a lot like the equality of outcome idea, or as the [Dodo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodo_(Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland)?wprov=sfti1) said: “[...] everybody has won and all must have prizes.”

Fuck that. Well done Steve.
