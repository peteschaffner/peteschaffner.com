# All Things Being Equal

> There’s a concept in some countries called the **tall poppy syndrome**, where everybody has to be average. It’s culturally very important for everybody to be the same. If anybody ever sticks their head up and says, “No, no, I can do something special,” or “I can be special,” they get it chopped off.

> There’s a major urge in American society today to implement the tall poppy syndrome. It’s this movement right now in politics and economics, this purported ideal that everybody ought to be equal, which is to say, for nobody to be special. Steve embodied the other side of that. The whole point of Steve, and the whole point of Apple, was to be special, was to be the tall poppy.”

This passage by Marc Andreessen in the foreword of *Becoming Steve Jobs* got me rethinking about a subject that has been eating at me for some time: the conflation of equal opportunity with equal outcome.

“Tall poppy syndrome” sounds a lot like the equality of outcome idea, or as the [Dodo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodo_(Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland)?wprov=sfti1) put it: “Everybody has won and all must have prizes.”

Fuck all that. Well done, Steve.
