<p>I recently took a break from my work on Bear and made a new icon for <a href="https://img2icnsapp.com">Image2icon</a>. The original was made by <a href="http://www.konstantindatz.de">Konstantin Datz</a>, and it was gorgeous.</p>

<br>
<p>It was a bit intimidating to reimagine it for Big Sur, but Iâ€™m happy with how it turned out.</p>
