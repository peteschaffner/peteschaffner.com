Imagine, for a moment, that you just got your first iPad/iPhone/Mac/Apple product. How would you feel? I’d bet pretty damn good.

Apple still makes great products, and dare I say, great software. Much better than most. Sure they make mistakes and make crappy decisions too, but all-in-all, they are doing a darn good job.

I get really annoyed hearing people constantly putting down everything Apple does, yet continue to religiously use their stuff. How quickly Apple owes you something, eh? If you don’t like it, you can always use a PC, or an Android phone.
