# Hi, I'm Pete

I'm a software designer from Indiana, living in France with my [wife](https://lauraschaffner.com), daughter and dog. Behind the computer, I'm a [Bear](https://bear.app) and pixel wrangler with a love for Apple, native apps, the view-source web and typography. 

Away from the screen, I enjoy long walks in the woods, finding smooth stones and avoiding boars.

I'm generally an open book, so please feel free to reach out. I'm available on [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog/peteschaffner), [GitHub](https://github.com/peteschaffner) and via [email](mailto:hello@peteschaffner.com).
