# Hi, I'm Pete

I'm an American software designer based in Paris, France. I'm passionate about Apple platforms, native software, the view-source web and learning by doing. Away from the computer I'm a husband, a father and a lover of the wild.

Professionally, I work at [Shiny Frog](http://www.shinyfrog.net) wrangling pixels and [bears](https://bear.app).

I'm generally an open book, so please feel free to reach out. I'm available on [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog/peteschaffner), [GitHub](https://github.com/peteschaffner) and via [email](mailto:hello@peteschaffner.com).
