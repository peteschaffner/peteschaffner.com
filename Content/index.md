# Hi, I'm Pete

I'm an American software designer based in Paris, France. I'm passionate about Apple platforms, native software, the view-source web and learning by doing. Away from the computer I'm a husband, a father and a lover of the wild.

Professionally, I work at Google where I lead the design of [Chrome for iOS/iPadOS](/work/#chrome).

I'm generally an open book, so please feel free to reach out. I'm available on [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog/peteschaffner), [GitHub](https://github.com/peteschaffner) and via [email](mailto:peteschaffner@icloud.com).
