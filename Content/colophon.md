# Colophon

This site is set in [Valkyrie](https://mbtype.com/fonts/valkyrie/), built with [Publish](https://github.com/JohnSundell/Publish), and hosted on a [Linode nanode](https://www.linode.com/products/nanodes/). I use [Site.js](https://sitejs.org) for local development, and also as the live site’s web server. You can check out the source [here](https://github.com/peteschaffner/peteschaffner.com).

Valkyrie is a humanist typeface made by [Matthew Butterick](https://mbtype.com/bio.html) that has a beautiful calligraphic feel. In order to really appreciate it and improve this site’s typography, I’ve enabled ligatures and kerning. There are other typographic features being controlled via CSS as well, so I encourage you to view the source and poke around.

As for content management, I’ve used many static site generators in the past (including [one I made](https://github.com/hagerstown/comprehensive-plan)), but decided to use Publish because it is written in Swift (I make iOS/macOS apps), and it is a joy to hack on in Xcode. I wrote [a post](/words/a-new-year-a-new-site) that talks in more detail about the technical bits and my motivations. 

It may also interest some that this blog supports title-less posts by design, making it easy and efficient to get thoughts out without stewing over an appropriate title. This also works really well for integrating with [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog).
